# Continuous Integration (CI)

Implementation of a Continuous Integration server built from the skeleton code [smallest-java-ci](https://github.com/KTH-DD2480/smallest-java-ci). The CI contains the core features of continuous integration; each time the GitHub webhook registers a push event to the server, the push is compiled and tested by the CI-server, alongside the resuklts of the tests and the status of the commit is set and a notification is sent out by email. The CI server also stores the history of all previous builds alongside all build details.
